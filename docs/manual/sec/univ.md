# Systems and System Objects

An important aspect of Naev is the universe. The universe is formet by isolated systems, of which only one is simulated at any given time. The systems are connected to each other forming a large graph. Each system can contain an arbitrary number of objects known as *System Objects (Spobs)*, which the player can, for example land on or perform other actions.
