   <bar>The bar is just off the starport with a great view of the harbor. You could watch the fishermen run frantically about attending their duties for hours.</bar>
   <description>The surface of the planet is predominantly covered with water and the planetary climate is characterized by abundant precipitation and strong winds, though sufficiently tolerable to make costly weather modification equipment unnecessary. Habitable land is often characterized by soft meadows, swamps and dense forests. The resource base of Caladan consists mainly of agriculture and biomass, with the locally bred and grown pundi rice being its main export, and fishing a traditional source of sustenance for its people. Other traditional products include wine and various livestock, most prominently cattle. Cuisine on Caladan is rather refined, with most dishes containing meat.</description>

   <description>Eiroik was a former mining planet under Empire rule, known for its toxic atmosphere and difficult, rough terrain produced through millenia of volcanic activity. The few human colonies were eradicated by the Collective. The generators have failed and the former spaceport lies in ruins. All that remains is dust.</description>

   <bar>Since you aren't allowed in the fancier bars you wander into the spaceport bar. A simple, utilitarian bar patronized largely by off-duty dock workers and terraformers, it is nonetheless kept immaculately clean. You can only imagine how luxurious the Emperor's personal bar must be.</bar>
   <description>Polaris Prime has recently become home to the Emperor himself as he plans and constructs his new stronghold on Emperor's Fist. It is an immense station with booming commerce, with a large loading area and frequent freight transfers between the station and Emperor's Fist below.</description>

   <description>Selphod is a harsh and barren ice planet. Most of the locals have never ventured outside the established bases. Outdoor travels require heavy thermal protection with a personal generator to keep the wearer from succumbing to hypothermia. Many have met a swift, excruciatingly painful end by venturing out in ill-sealed thermal suits.</description>

   <description>Raglan Outpost was established after the Dvaered-Frontier war broke out before the Incident. To this day the Frontier still is demanding for its dismantling in the halls of the Emperor, although he has yet to make a statement. Meanwhile the Dvaereds use this base extensively in their fight against the FLF.</description>

   <description>Named after the guardian dog of hell for its role in monitoring and observing the immense Sol nebula. It was created shortly after the nebula stabilized. Exact details are confidential and there's more than enough military influence to make it suspicious. With all the conspiracy theories around the Incident, one can never be too sure where reality ends and fiction starts.</description>

   <bar>The Tau Prime algae has a powerful odour which pervades the bar. The air is wreathed in the smell, such that you can taste it. It doesn't taste nearly as good unprocessed. Most algae runners stop to grab drinks between runs to try to get the taste of the algae out of their mouth, though the liquors the bar serves happen to be made with processed algae.</bar>
   <description>Tau Station was constructed with the sole purpose of exploiting the algae produced on Tau Prime. Being a completely oceanic world with a highly corrosive atmosphere, it was deemed more profitable to build an orbiting station, rather than a platform city on the surface. From the station windows you can see heavy algae collectors flying to and from the surface on their endless algae runs.</description>

   <bar>The Lost Drunk isn't much of a bar. The high price of most beverages and the low population results in few customers. From what you can see it's mainly shipping pilots and the odd mercenary sitting apart from each other. Not a jolly place.</bar>
   <description>Oma is one of the harsher desert worlds. The external temperature varies nearly 400 degrees each day, making it completely incapable of sustaining human life outside of climate-controlled bases. The lack of proper terraforming equipment also makes it hard on the visitors by the drastic temperature changes they endure across the base.</description>

   <bar>The drinks served in the Furnace, as the bar calls itself, are a rather curious sort. They are generally very strong and served at a warm temperature. The house specialties also contain volcanic ash which is harvested on the planet surface. A strange bar indeed.</bar>
   <description>Doranthex Prime is a mostly-molten planet. One of the few pieces of solid land, a small island drifts around the around the northern polar region. On this island the Dvaered have established a small base, primarily for research and military prototyping, though civilians are allowed in the main facilities. Due to the intense temperatures, the base is shielded by over 50m of temperature isolation plating, which affords no view of the planet itself once a ship has landed.</description>

   <description>Torloth is a heavy mining planet. It has rich ores and minerals in abundance with no local fauna to speak of. It's one of the strongholds of the Nexus corporation, housing some of their important ship factories, though the heavy gravity of the planet necessitates constructing larger ships off-world. Torloth produces ships exclusively for delivery to Nexus depots and endorsed shipyards, and does not operate any publicly-accessible shipyards.</description>

   <bar>The Goddard Bar is, unsurprisingly, an obsolete model of their eponymous ship, stripped and refitted in the form of a bar. It's surprisingly comfortable and cozy as a bar, although every so often you can hear creaking in the ancient metal frame.</bar>
   <description>Zhiru was a quiet planet, home of House Goddard, one of the minor Houses. House Goddard began designing a spacecraft, based on their airborne planes. The result was the massive Goddard, named after the house that created it. The ship was a massive success and granted House Goddard fame throughout the galaxy. Now Zhiru has a booming spacecraft industry, specialized in the creation and maintenance of the Goddard ships. This is all possible due to the weak gravity and atmosphere that envelops Zhiru, which allows the massive spacecraft to land and take off with little difficulty.</description>

   <bar>The Slop and Grill is one of the nastiest taverns in the universe. The food and drink don't help matters. Most of it is brewed on New Haven and wouldn't pass any of the minimal health insurance tests. Some of the booze even doubles as ship fuel if needed.The clients are also deep space thugs, pirates, black marketers, mercenaries and other shady folk that insist on keeping the ground coated with blood and broken teeth. Not a great place to bring the family.</bar>
   <description>New Haven is a small planet located beyond the boundaries of law and justice. Founded by Bartax the Great, one of the most successful pirates to ever live, after Haven was annihilated.The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic and has high levels of radiation outside of the stronghold. These very features are what made the Empire classify it as uninhabitable, as it lacks strategic resources necessary to justify the cost of terraforming. Its distance from other civilized worlds affords it protection from prying eyes.</description>

   <bar>The bar walls are decorated with pictures of Empire soldiers who have fallen in the fight against Haven and piracy in general. It has become customary for the Empire to post pictures of the fallen, honouring those who gave their lives protecting the Empire's ideals. They are working on another addition to be able to fit more pictures.</bar>
   <description>Zabween is an old station. It was first created as an outpost to fight piracy, but with the destruction of the Haven it has settled into a more traditional role. It presently functions as a largely commercial station, trading in many commodities. It keeps a museum with all sorts of ships and weapons that were used in the final fight against Haven.</description>

   <bar>The bar is very large, and yet has fairly few patrons. You notice the drink list has a "living" menu. When you ask the bartender about them, he says they specialize in drinks containing living creatures. Generally jellyfish, but sometimes small cephalopods, or more exotic beings. As exotic cultures go, Cetrat is among the stranger.</bar>
   <description>Cetrat is a small aquatic planet known for its medical algae. No one has been able to reproduce it exactly as it is in the wild, but with the abundance of it throughout the planet's massive ocean, there has been little effort in that field.</description>

   <bar>The Raelid bar fits the Dvaered stereotype well. It's one of the more prominent areas as soon as you exit the docking area, and, as many Dvaered bars seem to be, it's much larger than it functionally needs to be. Far from the spotless bars of Polaris Prime, it's encrusted with dirt and you can sense the presence of other patrons by their smell alone. Truly, a Dvaered bar.</bar>
   <description>Constructed by many captured and then enslaved FLF armsmen. The station seems sturdy, but you can't help wondering whether there's a bomb hidden somewhere, waiting to kill the Dvaered oppressors.</description>

   <bar>The Dowue Spaceport Bar is better known as the Frozen Shrimp after some ancient crustaceans found during the construction of the spaceport. It is a place where most of the personnel spend their time. The dangers, even with protective goggles, of the Dowue Syndrome persuade most people to stay indoors, and the bar lies in the heart of the spaceport.</bar>
   <description>Dowue is a planet known for the infamous "Dowue Syndrome", a condition where patients will temporarily go insane with hysteria due to prolonged expose of certain visual wavelengths. This was at first attributed a contaminated shipment of food, but later it was found that the sun in the Apez system emitted abnormal wavelengths, whose effects where multiplied by contaminants in Dowue's atmosphere. Shortly thereafter, it became mandatory for all personnel to wear special goggles designed to filter out the harmful light.</description>

   <description>Renowned for its outfit market and shipyards. Almost the entire Darkshed station is dedicated to trading outfits and ships. Mercenaries and bounty hunters from all over the galaxy come here to see try newest enhancements available on the market. This tends to also attract many of the shadier characters in the universe, winding up with frequent fights where they test their newly bought outfits.</description>

   <bar>The spaceport bar is approximately 3 kilometres below the surface of the planet. The walls are constructed from a hardened, transparent polymer that allows you to see into the darkness of the water. Every so often you can see gelatinous creatures sliding around, barely illuminated by the bar lighting.</bar>
   <description>Anecu is a completely aquatic planet. Its surface is covered completely by water. In the shallow areas great underwater cities are constructed, as the climate above the water can be very harsh (waves been recorded to be up to 2 kilometres high). The planet boasts extensive ship-designing facilities, using the high-pressure of the water as a benchmark against which ships are measured.</description>

   <bar>This bar is the standard-issue model that can be found on unpopular mining colonies throughout the galaxy. It's essentially a regular prefab habitation unit converted to a bar. It has all the amenities and features you might expect in a public facility, but it offers none of the comfort that bars on metropolis planets tend to sport. The liquor served here is often pretty strong, which is in no small part due to the planet's harsh environment.</bar>
   <description>Durea is not a terribly pleasant place to live, as it orbits its star a little too distantly for comfort, which leaves most of the planet covered in show and ice. Only a small portion of the surface thaws far enough in summer for the mining operations, but despite that the riches underneath the crust compel the hardy population to dig. Indeed, if one day resources in the galaxy grow sparse enough, Durea may well find itself in an economically superior position.</description>
