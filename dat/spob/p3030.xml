  <description>The planet seems to be enveloped in a never-ending sandstorm that tears at the outter hull of your ship, until you find a small protected alcove where you can land. Your ship sensors pick up some strang undalitions beneath the surface, however, you are unable to determine the exact source nor get any closer to the source. The hostility of the planet makes you feel like you should not overstay your welcome.</description>
