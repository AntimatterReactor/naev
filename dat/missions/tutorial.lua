   text[2] = [[Welcome to the tutorial, %s.]]
   -- Step 1
   title[2] = "Flight Tutorial"
   text[3] = [[We'll start off by flying around. Use %s and %s to turn, and %s to accelerate. Try flying around the planet.]]
   -- Step 2
   text[4] = [[Now, we'll try braking. Since you can only accelerate forward, you'll have to turn around and accelerate to brake. To make this easier, you can use %s to turn around, facing the opposite direction that you're moving. The stars in the background are a good indication of your velocity. 

Try braking to a stop now.]]
   text[5] = [[Now you're getting the hang of it. Moving well is integral to success in NAEV.]]
   -- Step 3
   title[3] = "Targeting Tutorial"
   text[6] = [[Next, we'll work on targeting.

You have multiple options:
 %s cycles through ships in the system.
 %s cycles the ships backwards.
 %s targets the nearest ship.
 %s targets the nearest enemy.
 %s clears the current target.]]
   text[7] = [[I'll bring in several ships so you can try targeting. You'll notice your targeted ship is highlighted on the radar (Top right). You can use the %s and %s keys to change the scale of the radar. Yellow is neutral, red is hostile, green is friendly and grey is disabled. The new ships will be yellow.]]
   -- Step 4
   title[4] = "Combat Tutorial"
   text[8] = [[Now, let's try using the weapon systems.

There are three important keys:
 %s fires primary weapons.
 %s selects secondary weapon.
 %s fires secondary weapon.]]
   text[9] = [[Your ship, a Llama, has two laser cannons as its primary weapons, so we'll try using them. Captain Target Practice, our designated test pilot, will soon enter. You can target him with %s, %s or %s. Following that, approach him and shoot him with %s until he has been disabled. You can also use %s to auto-face targets you have selected.

Do be warned that Captain T. Practice is known for his... talkative nature.]]
   -- Step 5
   text[10] = [[Good. Now that the Llama is disabled, you can board it. To board a ship you must target it and then stop directly above it.

Once you're on top of the ship you can press %s which will allow you to board the ship to steal resources.

Try boarding the ship now.]]
   -- Back to Step 4
   text[11] = [[You killed Captain T. Practice! You should be ashamed. Oh well, we'll ship out a replacement momentarily.]]
   text[12] = [[If the Llama had money or cargo, you could attempt to steal it. Your probability of success is based on the size of your crew versus theirs. The larger your crew, the higher your odds of success. Since Captain T. Practice has nothing, just take off and we'll introduce a real enemy.]]
   -- Step 6
   text[13] = [[Now comes the real challenge. I'll bring in a real pirate to see how you fare with him. 

Don't worry, help is on the way.]]
   text[14] = [[That wasn't so hard, was it? We'll now learn more about some essential non-combat skills.

Landing allows you to not only regenerate your shield and armour, but to trade goods, purchase outfits for your ship, and buy new ships.

It takes time to land, so if you're in a hurry for a mission, it's best to make as few stops as possible.]]
   -- Step 7
   title[5] = "Landing Tutorial"
   text[15] = [[Landing is also how you save in NAEV. This can be beneficial, but it's best to be careful. If you've failed an important mission, you should reload before landing again.

The keys involved with landing are:
 %s cycles through planets.
 %s lands or targets the nearest planet if none selected. 

The first press acquires landing clearance, the second lands the ship.]]
   text[16] = [[In order to land, you need to come to a near-stop above the planet or station you're trying to land on, much like boarding a ship. 

Try landing now.]]
