Then a voice speaks, louder than an earthquake. It seems to sound inside your bones and from the very centre of the earth. "Oh crap..." it says.

Another voice laughs, musically, as if world itself were singing. "bobbens, did you just destroy the universe, again?"

"Mmmm, hold on," first voice rumbles. "...SIGSEGV... libc start main+0xe5... ah ha!  There's the problem."  You feel something fundamental in the fabric of reality change. The sensation is like sneezing and hiccuping at the same time. "There that should fix it."

A window opens in the darkness, infinitely far away and infinitely large. A face peeps down at you from the height of eternity.

"Everything all right in there?"]] --yes/no choice

-- If yes, the voice of your creator speaks to you:
   title[2] = "The voice of the creator"
   text[2] = [["Good. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please don't worry, I'll have reality reloaded again in just a sec."

The creator turns to go, then pauses.

"By the way, we're working hard on improving life, the universe, and all that, but we're a bit short handed. If you like this existence but think the details could be improved, the universe creation team could use your help. We'd be especially happy to see you if you have any special skill in drawing planets, designing ships, scripting the underlying laws of nature, or composing the music of the spheres. For information on how to contribute, just point your web-of-reality browser to http://code.google.com/p/naev/."

The clockmaker lifts his eyes up beyond your frame of reference and smiles.

"OK then. Pushed. And we're back in 3... 2... 1..."]]

-- If no, the voice of your creator speaks to you:
   title[3] = "The voice of the creator"
   text[3] = [["Oh sorry about that. We're working hard on improving life, the universe, and all that, but the team is a bit short handed. Don't worry, I'll have reality reloaded again in just a sec."
   
The creator turns to go, then pauses.

"I tell you what: the universe creation team could really use your help.
