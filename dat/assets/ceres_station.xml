  <description>You see what looks like was once a small research station. While the inside is largely intact, there are large plasma scars all over the hull of the station, and what seems to be large amounts of structural damage from some sort of collision. A brief inspection of the inside makes it clear that there are no survivors. What was once a simple shipyard is also heavily damaged, and what is more puzzling is that it semes like all the fuel has been taken through a large hole in the exterior.</description>
