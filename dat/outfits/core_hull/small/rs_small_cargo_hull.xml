  <description>The Red Star organization undergoes relief efforts in areas of the galaxy where war and piracy are constant concerns. Because their operations preclude the use of stealth they developed a series of hull patterns to better suit their specific needs. Red Star cargo hulls provide increased defense against missile attacks through greater kinetic shock absorption and active jamming systems (one of the few defenses not yet disallowed by inter-House treaties). This particular design is suitable for small vessels and has already proven itself by running vaccines with Llamas through a Wild Ones blockade.</description>
