  <description>Developed by the Red Star Organization for their medical relief ships, this cargo hull and its variants have been made publicly available in an attempt to raise funds. Red Star hulls increase resilience against missile attacks via lock disruption and shock absorption. Though this comes at the cost of a larger radar profile, most relief efforts are already barred from using silent running procedures.</description>
