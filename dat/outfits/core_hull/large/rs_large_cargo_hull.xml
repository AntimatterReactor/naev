  <description>The Red Star Organization's specialized cargo hulls have helped bring more than a few freighters to their destinations that would have otherwise been effectively defenseless from attack against pirates and privateers. As the Red Star is barred by treaty from equipping most weapons, these hulls instead seek to blunt the effect of missile weapons via jamming and impact resistance. Those few raiders stupid enough to press on usually find that the largest Red Star ships are not disallowed from carrying an extensive array of short-range defensive turrets.</description>
